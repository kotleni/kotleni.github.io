                            I'm a software engineer, open-source enthusiast, and retro tech lover.
                            <strong> I started my career as an Android developer</strong>, spending
                            three years crafting mobile experiences <strong>before shifting my focus to web
                            development in 2024</strong>. I've been started writing on this blog for the past
                            decade, sharing insights on coding, open-source projects, and my passion for all
                            things retro. Also, by the way â€” <i>I use Arch</i>, btw.
                        </p>
                        <p className="hero-description">
                            Also i enjoy languages, learning new things, coding, and making cool stuff for Linux.
                            When I'm not playing retro games or tweaking my Linux setup, I'm contributing to
                            open-source projects or experimenting with new tech.
