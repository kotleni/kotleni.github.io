# The sixth iteration of my website.

Throughout my life, I've created a bunch of different websites with various designs, using different technologies - but none of them ever felt quite right for my personal page.

You can find the source code for some of my previous websites (different branches) in my GitHub [repository](https://github.com/kotleni/kotleni.github.io/).

This is also the first public post I've ever written. I've always maintained a micro-blogs in a social networks to write about things, but it was never anything serious – just pictures, memes, screenshots, links, and so on.

## My brand-new website

I really appreciate technical aesthetics in everything, including web design. One of my previous and most favorite websites was a personal page styled like documentation. Therefore, in new website I made something simple, stylish (in some way), and informative that also has additional space for other content (like a blog, portfolio, projects, and more).

## Used technologies

First of all - I used TypeScript and React, because it's my main stack.

But instead of Vite as bundler I created this project using NextJS by several reasons:

**1. Thoughts about the future**
Maybe in the future I will add some dynamic features (e.g., a view count for the blog).

**2. Next.js features for static sites**
Initially, I'll host this site on GitHub Pages, so I can't use server features. However, I can still use awesome file-based routing, lazy image loading, and more.

**3. Why not?**
I pay the bills, so I can use whatever I want. Even PHP if I feel like it.

## What's next?

Soon I will bring more stuff to this website, such like portfolio, sandbox, extend blog features and more...

And also I have some plans about start new pet project, releasing one more package to npm and writing at least one more blog post.
