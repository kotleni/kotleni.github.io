                    Throughout my life, I've created a bunch of different
                    websites with various designs, using different technologies
                    - but none of them ever felt quite right for my personal
                    page.

                    This is also the first public post I've ever written. I've
                    always maintained a micro-blogs in a social networks to
                    write about things, but it was never anything serious â€“ just
                    pictures, memes, screenshots, links, and so on.

                    I really appreciate technical aesthetics in everything,
                    including web design. One of my previous and most favorite
                    websites was a personal page styled like documentation.
                    Therefore, in new website I made something simple, stylish
                    (in some way), and informative that also has additional
                    space for other content (like a blog, portfolio, projects,
                    and more).
                </TextBlock>
            </section>
            <section className="flex flex-col gap-1">
                <Title text="Used technologies" />
                <TextBlock>
                    First of all - I used TypeScript and React, because it's my
                    main stack.
                </TextBlock>

                <TextBlock topPadding={1}>
                    But instead of Vite as bundler I created this project using
                    NextJS by several reasons:
                </TextBlock>
                <OrderedList items={nextjsReasons} />
            </section>
            <section className="flex flex-col gap-1">
                <Title text="What's next?" />
                <TextBlock>
                    Soon I will bring more stuff to this website, such like
                    portfolio, sandbox, extend blog features and more...
                </TextBlock>
                <TextBlock>
                    And also I have some plans about start new pet project,
                    releasing one more package to npm and writing at least one
                    more blog post.
